# Defintion
- Acids only show the properties of acids when they are **dissolved** in water
	- As it **dissociates** in water to form [[Hydrogen]] [[Ions]]
	- The hydrogen ions are responsible for acidic properties

# Strength of Acids
## Strong Acids
- Have weakly bonded hydrogen atoms and they dissociates **completely** in water
- Therefore, the solution of strong acids will have a higher concentraion of **[[Mobile Charge Carieers]]**
- Can conduct [[Electricity]]
- Have a [[pH]] value below 7 ([[Acidic]])
- Reacts with [[Metal Carbonate]] to give off [[Carbon Dioxide]]
- Examples:
1.  Chloric acid: HClO3
2.  Hydrobromic acid: HBr 
3.  Hydrochloric acid: HCl 
4.  Hydroiodic acid: HI 
5.  Nitric acid: HNO3 
6.  Perchloric acid: HClO4 
7.  Sulfuric acid: H2SO4

## Weak Acids
- Have strongly bonded hydrogen atoms and they dissociates partially in water
- Therefore, the solution of weak acids will have a lower concentraion of Mobile Charge Carieers
- Does not conduct [[Electricity]]
- Has a [[pH]] value above 7 ([[Alkali]])
	- Does not react with [[Metal Carbonate]]
