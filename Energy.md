# What is Energy
Energy is the capacity to do [[Work]]
The [[SI unit]] of energy is the [[Joule]](J)
Energy is a [[Scalar]] quanitity (only has [[Magnitude]])

# Forms Of Energy
## [[Mechanical Energy]]
- [[Potential Energy ]]
	- [[Elastic Potential Energy]]
	- [[Gravitational Potential Energy]]
	- [[Chemical Potential Energy]]
- [[Kinetic Energy]]
## [[Electrical Energy]]
## [[Thermal Energy]]
## [[Light]]
## [[Nuclear Energy ]]

## Conversation Of Energy
Energy cannot be **created** nor **destroyed** but can be **converted** from one form to another
The total energy in an isolated system is constant

The grand equation of conservation of energy is as follows:

[[Kinetic Energy]] (Intial) + [[Potential Energy]] (Inital) = [[Kinetic Energy]] (Final) + [[Potential Energy]] (Final) + [[Energy Loss]]
