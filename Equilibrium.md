# Equilibrium
Equilibrium is the state in which the net force will be zero since the opposing forces balance [[Newtons's First Law]]of motion also known as the law of inertia. An object is at rest because it is experiencing the same force from all directions making the net force equal to zero. That means the object is in a state of equilibrium. Therefore, Newton’s first law of motion is called the law of equilibrium.
