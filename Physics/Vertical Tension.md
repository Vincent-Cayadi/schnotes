# Equation
## F<sub>net</sub> = Tension - Weight
$ma = Tension - Weight$
$ma = Tension - mg$
$Tension = ma + mg$
$m(a + g) = T$

## At Rest
![[T-Rest]]
## Upwards/Downwards Velocity
Since [[Acceleration]] is the rate of change of velocity, if the [[Velocity]] is not changing the [[Acceleration]] is 0 and thus the Tension does not change 
## Upwards/Downwards Acceleration
