# The ideal Pendulum
- When a pendulum is displaced to one side, it gains [[Gravitational Potential Energy]]
- When the raised pendum is relased, it swings towards the [[Newtons Laws|Equilibrium]] the poistion it will be when at rest
- The [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] is converted to [[Kinetic Energy]]
- At [[Equilibrium]], [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] is at its minimum, while [[Kinetic Energy]] is at its maximum
	- [[Energy]] is converted from one form to another
- From [[Equilibrium]] the bob now swings upwards to the other side. It now loses [[Kinetic Energy]] and gains [[Gravitational Potential Energy]]
- ### Loss in [[Kinetic Energy]] = Gain in [[Gravitational Potential Energy]]
- If this is an ideal pendulum, the bob will swing up to the same height as the [[Displacement]] on the other side
	- This is due to the [[Energy#Conversation Of Energy]]
