Many [[Salt]]s combine with water molecules to form crystalline solids

The process of obtaining Water of Crystallization salts is called [[Crystallization]]

They are perfectly dry but are chemically held together with water molecules to form crystals also known as water of crystallization or hydrated [[Salt]]s

[[Salt]]s that do not contain water of crystallization are called anhydrous [[Salt]]s.

To get an anhydrous [[Salt]] you just heat it
