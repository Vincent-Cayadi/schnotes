# Solution
A solution consists of a [[Solute]] dissolved in a [[Solvent]].
Characteristics:
- A solution is ==homogeneous== (throughout)
-  A solution is ==transparent== (and clear)
Recall: A solution is homogeneous when the color, density, appearance and other physical
and chemical properties are the same in every part of the solution.
A solution obtained should be either colored or colorless. Students often write a clear solution is seen. It is redundant as all solutions are clear. 

**==Do not==** use the term ‘transparent’ to describe a ==colorless== solution.
