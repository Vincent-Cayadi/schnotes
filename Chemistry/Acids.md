#acids 
# Definition
- Acids only show the properties of acids when they are **dissolved** in water
	- As it **dissociates** in water to form [[Hydrogen]] [[Ions]]
	- The hydrogen ions are responsible for acidic properties

# Strength of Acids
## Strong Acids
- Have weakly bonded hydrogen atoms and they dissociates **completely** in water
- Therefore, the solution of strong acids will have a higher concentration of **[[Mobile Charge Carriers]]**
- Can conduct [[Electricity]]
- Have a [[pH]] value below 7 ([[pH#Acidic]])
- Reacts with Metal Carbonate to give off [[Carbon Dioxide]]
- Examples:
1.  Hydrochloric acid: HCl 
2.  Nitric acid: HNO<sub>3 </sub>
3.  Sulfuric acid: H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>

## Weak Acids
- Have strongly bonded hydrogen atoms and they dissociates partially in water
- Therefore, the solution of weak acids will have a **lower concentration** of Mobile Charge Carriers
- Does not conduct [[Electricity]]
- Has a [[pH]] value above 7 ([[pH#Alkali]])
	- Does not react with Metal Carbonate
