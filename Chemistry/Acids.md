#acids 
# Definition
- Acids only show the properties of acids when they are **dissolved** in water
	- As it **dissociates** in water to form [[Hydrogen]] [[Ions]]
	- The hydrogen ions are responsible for acidic properties

# Strength of Acids
## Strong Acids
- Have weakly bonded hydrogen atoms and they dissociates **completely** in water
- Therefore, the solution of strong acids will have a higher concentration of **[[Mobile Charge Carriers]]** and H<sup>+</sub> ions
- Can conduct [[Electricity]]
- Have a [[pH]] value below 7 ([[pH#Acidic]])
- Reacts with Metal Carbonate to give off [[Carbon Dioxide]]
- Examples:
1.  Hydrochloric acid: HCl 
2.  Nitric acid: HNO<sub>3 </sub>
3.  Sulfuric acid: H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>

## Weak Acids
- Have strongly bonded hydrogen atoms and they dissociates partially in water
- Therefore, the solution of weak acids will have a **lower concentration** of [[Mobile Charge Carriers]] and H<sup>+</sub> ions
- Does not conduct [[Electricity]]
- Has a [[pH]] value above 7 ([[pH#Alkali]])
	- Does not react with Metal Carbonate
- Examples:
- Carbonic Acid: H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
- Ethanoic Acid: CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H
- Phosphoric Acid: H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>

# Types of Acids
==**Mono**==basic - 1 Molecule of the acid yields 1 H<sup>+</sup> ion when dissociated
	HNO<sub>3</sub>(aq) +H<sub>2</sub>O(l) -> H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
==**Di**==basic - 1 Molecule of the acid yields 2 H<sup>+</sup> ion when dissociated
	H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq) +2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) -> 2H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>
==**Tri**==basic - 1 Molecule of the acid yields 3 H<sup>+</sup> ion when dissociated
	H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>(aq) +3H<sub>2</sub>O(l) -> 3H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>

# Reaction 
## With [[Metal]]s

Metal + Acid -> [[Salt]] + Hydrogen Gas (H<sub>2</sub> (g))

|   Metal   | Symbol | Reaction With Dilute Acid |
|:---------:|:------:|:-------------------------:|
| Potassium |   K    |      Yes (Explosive)      |
|  Sodium   |   Na   |      Yes (Explosive)      |
|  Calcium  |   Ca   |      Yes (Explosive)      |

|   Zinc    |   Zn   |            Yes            |
|   Iron    |   Fe   |            Yes            |
|   Lead    |   Pb   |        Yes (Slow)         |
| Hydrogen  |   H    |             -             |
|  Copper   |   Cu   |            No             |
|  Silver   |   Ag   |            No             |
|   Gold    |   Au   | No                          |

Note: 

Concentrated Nitric Acid react with metals such as Copper but does no liberate Hydrogen Gas. Instead a metal nitrate ([[Salt]]), water and nitrogen dioxide is formed.

Lead will react with dilute nitric acid but appears to not react with dilute hydrochloric acid and dilute sulfuric acid. This is due to the layer of Lead (II) Chloride or Lead(II) Sulfate formed from the initial reaction between the metal and acid. The layer is insoluble and quickly forms a coating around the metal, preventing any further reaction.

| Metal   | Acid              | Insoluble Coating  |
| :-------: | :-----------------: | :------------------: |
| Lead    | Sulfuric Acid     | Lead (II) Sulfate  |
| Lead    | Hydrochloric Acid | Lead (II) Chloride |
| Calcium | Sulfuric Acid     | Calcium Sulfate    | 


## To Prepare Lead (II) Sulfate
Use aqueous reactant like Lead Nitrate, Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (aq) -> PbSO<sub>4</sub> + 2HNO<sub>3</sub>(aq)
Solid Product can be separated by filtration
