# Notes
## Ammonia

## Carbon Dioxide
This is due to a chemical reaction happened between Carbon Dioxide gas and [[Limewater]]

## Chlorine Gas
The reason why chlorine bleaches red litmus paper is that it is very acidic and thus it forms a compound that are present in bleach, hypochlorous acid. 
Chlorine gas reacts with water to produce an acidic solution which is also an effective bleach. The acidic solution formed on the damp litmus paper turns the indicator red. Then the bleach turns the red color to white.

## Hydrogen
The lighted splint ignites the hydrogen which burns explosively to make a loud sound
## Oxygen
The glowing splint comes in contact with oxygen which is a fuel to the fire
## Sulfur Dioxide
This is aÂ [[Redox reaction]]. The permanganate ion (purple) is reduced to manganese(II) ion which is a very pale pink, or almost colorless. while sulfur dioxide is oxidized to the sulfate ion, which is colorless.
