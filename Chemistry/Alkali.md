# Definition
An alkali is a subset of a [[Base]]

It is a substance that dissociates in water to produce [[Hydroxide]] [[Ions]].

# Strength Of Alkali

## Stronk Alkali
A Strong alkali is one which dissociates completely in water to produce a ==high concentration== Of [[Hydroxide]] [[Ion]]s

Examples:
Sodium [[Hydroxide]]: NaOH
Potassium [[Hydroxide]]: KOH
Barium [[Hydroxide]]: Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub>

## Weak Alkali
A Weak Alkali is one which dissociates partially in water to produce a ==low concentration== of [[Hydroxide]] [[Ions]]

Examples:
Calcium [[Hydroxide]]: Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>
