Before continuing with Salt Prep, it is advised to understand what makes a [[Salt]], [[Solubility Of Solids]] and [[Experimental Techniques]]

  A[Salt Prep] --> B[Is the salt to be prepared in water?]
  B --> C[Yes] -->E[Reaction of an acid with a metal, base or carbonate] --> F[Yes] --> H["<b><u>Titration</u></b><br>Acid + Alkali (soluble base)<br>Acid + Soluble Carbonate"] --> J[Crystalize the filtrate and filter to obtain the crystals] --> K[Boom Salt Crystals]

  B --> D[No] --> N["Precipitation<br>Solution containing cation of the salt + solution containing anion of the salt"] --> O[Filter] --> K
```
The reason why we add in excess is so that all the metal, base or carbonate is used up in the reaction
