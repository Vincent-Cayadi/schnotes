# Definition

Salts the substance produced together with water when an [[Acids]] and [[Base]] react together

In general, a salt is the compound formed when a metallic [[Ions]] or an aluminum compound [[Ions]] replaces one or more hydrogen ions of an [[Acids]].

The contain a ==positive== [[Metal]] ion and a ==negative== [[Non-metal]] ion

# Making Salts
|   Name of Acid    |           Formula           | Anion in salt formed |
|:-----------------:|:---------------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Hydrochloric Acid |             HCl             |       Chloride       |
|   Sulfuric Acid   | H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> |       Sulfate        |
|    Nitric Acid    |       HNO<sub>3</sub>       |       Nitrate        |
| Phosphoric Acid                  |       H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>                      |           Phosphate           |

Although salts are formed during [[Neutralization]], not all salts are neutral 
	-NaHCO<sub>3</sub>is slightly acidic as it is still able to release a hydrogen ion in water (1st endpoint of titration)
	When there is a full replacement, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sup>3</sup>(2nd endpoint of titration), the salt is neutral.
