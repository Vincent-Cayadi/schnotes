Also known as Amphoteric Oxides, it can react with both [[Acids]] and [[Base]]s

Test with NaOH (aq) alone cannot distinguish Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Al<sup>3+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup>. Therefore, a test with NH<sub>3</sub> is needed to distinguish Zn<sup>2+</sup>

Al<sup>3+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup> cannot be distinguished using both NaOH (aq) and NH<sub>3</sub> (aq). Potassium Iodide (KI) can be used to distinguish Pb<sup>2+</sup> from Al<sup>3+</sup> as the lead(II) iodide PbI<sub>2</sub> formed is a ==yellow precipitate== while Aluminium Iodide All<sub>3</sub> is soluble so it is a ==colorless== solution
