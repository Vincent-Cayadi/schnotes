An [[Alkali]] is added to the [[Solution]] that contains the cation to [[Precipitate]] the insoluble [[Hydroxide]]
The cation is tested with both ==**aqueous sodium hydroxide**== NaOH(aq) and ==**aqueous ammonia**== NH<sub>3</sub> (aq)

- If the cation present in the [[Solution]] is ammonium ion, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, no [[Precipitate]] would be produced when NaOH (aq) is added. However, on heating, ammonia gas (NH<sub>3</sub>) will be liberated

### Test for H+
The presence of hydrogen ion, H+ (i.e. acid),it can be quickly tested using moist blue [[Litmus paper]]. It turns moist blue [[Litmus paper]].
