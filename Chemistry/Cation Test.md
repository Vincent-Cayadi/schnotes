An [[Alkali]] is added to the [[Solution]] that contains the cation to [[Precipitate]] the insoluble [[Hydroxide]]
The cation is tested with both ==**aqueous sodium hydroxide**== NaOH(aq) and ==**aqueous ammonia**== NH<sub>3</sub> (aq)

- If the cation present in the [[Solution]] is ammonium ion, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, no [[Precipitate]] would be produced when NaOH (aq) is added. However, on heating, ammonia gas (NH<sub>3</sub>) will be liberated

- Test with NaOH (aq) alone cannot distinguish Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Al<sup>3+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup>. Therefore, a test with NH<sub>3</sub> is needed to distinguish Zn<sup>2+</sup>
- Al<sup>3+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup> cannot be distinguished using both NaOH(aq) and NH<sub>3</sub>(aq). Potassium Iodide (KI) can be used to distinguish Pb<sup>2+</sup> from Al<sup>3+</sup> as the lead(II) iodide PbI<sub>2</sub> formed is a ==yellow precipitate== while Aluminum Iodide All<sub>3</sub> is soluble so it is a ==colorless== solution

### Test for H+
The presence of [[hydrogen]] ion, H+

(i.e. acid), can be quickly tested using moist blue litmus paper. It turns moist blue litmus red.
