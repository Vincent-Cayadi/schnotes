# Effervescence

A gas is usually seen as effervescence forming in a solution due to a chemical
reaction and not due to boiling.
Sometimes in heating a solid, the gas that is liberated has an odour or a colour change in the
residue is seen. Gases liberated by the reagents themselves should not be recorded as
observations e.g. heating aqueous ammonia gives off ammonia gas.
