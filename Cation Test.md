#cation

An [[Alkali]] is added to the [[Solution]] that contains the cation to [[Percipitate]] the insoluble [[Metal Hydroxide]] 
The cation is tested with both ==**aqeous sodium hydroxide**== NaOH(aq) and ==**aqeous ammonia**== NH<sub>3</sub> (aq)

- If the cation present in the [[Solution]] is ammonium ion, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, no [[Percipitate]] would be produced when NaOH (aq) is added. However, on heating, ammonia gas (NH<sub>3</sub>) will be liberated
- ## ALZ THE AMPHIBIAN!!! ðŸ¦Ž
- Test with NaOH (aq) alone cannot distinguish Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Al<sup>3+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup>. Therefore, a test with NH<sub>3</sub> is needed to distingiush Zn<sup>2+</sup>
- Al<sup>3+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup> cannot be distingushed using both NaOH(aq) and NH<sub>3</sub>(aq). Potassium Iodide (KI) can be used to distinguish Pb<sup>2+</sup> from Al<sup>3+</sup> as the lead(II) iodide PbI<sub>2</sub> formed is a ==yellow precipitate== while Aluminium Iodide All<sub>3</sub> is soluable so it is a ==colorless== solution



### Test for H+
The presence of [[hydrogen]] ion, H+

(i.e. acid), can be quickly tested using moist blue litmus

paper. It turns moist blue litmus red.
